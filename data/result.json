Overview**\nDevelop a Proof of Concept (PoC) for an AI-driven muti-agent application utilizing **. The system should enable natural language interaction, dynamic task orchestration, agent collaboration, and real-time visualization of workflow execution.\n\n---\n\n**2. Core Features**\n\n### 2.1 Natural Language Processing (NLP) Interface\n\n* Users can **describe workflow needs** via conversation with the **Host Agent**.\n* The system must parse and interpret these inputs into actionable intents.\n\n### 2.2 Workflow Composition\n\n* A **Master Agent** orchestrates task planning:\n\n  * Selects **Worker Agents** from an existing agent library.\n  * Arranges them in a **logical sequence** based on the user\u2019s needs.\n\n### 2.3 Workflow Execution\n\n* **Worker Agents** execute assigned tasks in order.\n* Each agent:\n\n  * Receives instructions from the Host Agent.\n  * Executes its task autonomously.\n  * Reports results and updates to the **Session State**.\n\n### 2.4 Frontend Visualization\n\n* A web-based UI will:\n\n  * **Dynamically visualize** workflow state and progress.\n  * Display results and status for each agent involved.\n  * Refresh in real-time as the workflow progresses.\n\n---\n\n**3. Technical Requirements**\n\n* **Backend**:\n\n  * Based on **Google ADK** for agent definition and orchestration.\n  * Session management for maintaining workflow context.\n\n* **Frontend**:\n\n  * Dynamic rendering of **workflow DAG or sequence view**.\n  * Real-time updates from backend using WebSocket or polling.\n\n* **Data**:\n\n  * Session State must persist user intent, task status, agent responses.\n\n---\n\n**4. Status & Next Steps**\n\n* **Current Status**: In Progress\n* **Tasks**:\n\n  * Define Host, Master, and Worker Agent behaviors.\n  * Build ADK-based backend logic.\n  * Design and implement dynamic frontend.\n  * Integrate session state management.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you'd like a breakdown into user stories or an architecture sketch next.\n"
