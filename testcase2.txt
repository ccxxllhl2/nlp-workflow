# Summary
Develop the workflow PoC based on ADK

## Description
This PoC is for a new workflow app with a multi-agent architecture by Google ADK. The following features will be implemented:

- **NLP Needs**: User can talk to the Host Agent about their needs within the flow.
- **Workflow Arrangement**: The Master Agent will collect Worker Agents from the library and confirm the sequence of jobs based on user needs.
- **Workflow Running**: Worker Agents will follow the Host Agent's order to complete their assigned jobs and then update the information to the Session State.
- **Show Workflow**: Develop a frontend to dynamically display the workflow state and the results of every agent.
